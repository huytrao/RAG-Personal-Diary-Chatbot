1. Data Flow
New Entry

User writes diary text

System chunks text into 300â€“500 tokens

Generate embeddings for each chunk

Store in vector DB with metadata {date, tags, sentiment, user_id}

Query

User asks: "What did I do last Sunday?"

Retriever searches top-k relevant chunks

LLM uses retrieved chunks + query to generate an answer

4. Key Components
a) Preprocessing
Remove stop words? (optional, embeddings usually handle context)

Sentence segmentation for long entries

Metadata tagging: date, mood, location (if extracted)

b) Retrieval
Hybrid search (semantic + keyword/date filter)

Date range filters for time-specific questions

Multi-vector approach: one for content, one for sentiment

c) Generation
Prompt template for answer:

css
Copy
Edit
You are a diary assistant. Use the retrieved diary entries to answer user questions truthfully.
If no relevant diary entry is found, say so.
Context:
{retrieved_entries}
Question:
{user_query}
